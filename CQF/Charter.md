## 1.挑战
鉴于CDS和eCQM质控指标紧密相关，拥有很多共同的需求，但是二者所采用的标准则是各异的，主要是表达患者数据和计算机化处理逻辑的方法是不同的

| 类别 | 患者数据|处理逻辑|     
| -- | -- | -- |      
| CDS | VMR | CDS knowledge artifact实施指南 |    
| ECQM | quality reporting data architecture物理模型quality data model逻辑模型 | Health quality measure format HQMF 物理模型Quality data model逻辑模型 |


## 2.项目范围
* 定义、确定 整合一下几类CDS和eCQM的标准
    * A——metadata元数据：确定两个领域公用的一些元数据，统一这些元数据的表达方式
    * B——患者数据模型:能够同时满足CDS和eCQM的需求
    * C——逻辑表达语言：开发一种能够表达两类逻辑的语言
* 对已有的CDS和eCQM标准进行重构，形成统一的标准
* 尽可能的对产生的标准进行试点并及时作出调整
* 利用临床质控人员的参与 提升产生的标准的可用性和严密性
* 支持这些标准在HL7的投票和发布


## 3.核心价值

Much of the standards harmonization work is already underway in HL7 work groups. The Clinical Quality Framework Standards and Interoperability (S&I) initiative will promote wider visibility into the standards under development and provide additional implementation-based feedback, leading to more robust specifications.

CQF Value Statement Pic 20140410.jpg
CDS and eCQM are complementary and essential components of clinical quality improvement (CQI). Harmonizing the electronic standards used for these two domains and developing a common Clinical Quality Framework will have a number of important benefits, including the following:

    Reduced implementer burden with regard to time and cost.
    Increased re-use of eCQM artifacts in CDS and vice versa.
    Improved standards quality through the unification of community effort.



Community involvement in the harmonization of the eCQM and CDS standards gives participants the following:

    The ability to accelerate the standards development process.
    Early access to standards under development for internal prototyping, etc.



Furthermore, implementation-based feedback will enhance the quality of the standards that are developed. Ultimately, the work of the CQF initiative will facilitate the achievement of improved clinical quality and outcomes.
## 4. 预期目标

    Harmonized standards for representation of quality improvement (CDS and eMeasures) artifacts and for exchange of data related to quality improvement.
    Alignment with Meaningful Use and other related regulations.
    Unification of the existing CDS and eCQM standards communities.
    Broader visibility into the harmonized standards being developed in HL7.
    Incorporation of implementation-based feedback into CDS and eCQM standards development activities.

## 7. 潜在风险
1.Given the aggressive timeline, a schedule delay in one item may have significant downstream scope and schedule impact.       

    Mitigation/Response: Prioritize activities and leverage community expertise.


2.Additional review and implementation-based feedback may introduce delays into the development of harmonized standards.     

    Mitigation/Response: Review and implementation feedback are critical to the quality of standards; the benefits outweigh the risk.


3.Implementation and piloting of non-final standards may result in “throwaway” work.     

    Mitigation/Response: Implementation feedback is critical to the quality of standards; the benefits outweigh the risk.


4.Vendors’ focus on Meaningful Use activities may impact their ability to participate in pilots.     

    Mitigation/Response: Focus on items already in EHR certification criteria (at least proposed), actively engage with vendors, and make tools and resources (e.g., an open-source environment) available to them to make participation easier and beneficial.




Additional risks and mitigations may be identified during discovery phase.
